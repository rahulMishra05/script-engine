# Cryptography Scripts

This directory contains all the scripts/tools which are somehow related to cryptography.

You can just execute/use cryptography scripts, by going in the base directory and executing this command in terminal `./cryptography.sh`.\
*Note: Yo go in base directory use this command `cd ../`*

If you want to use a particular script/tool, than go to that tool's folder and in the `README.md` file you will find a command to clone the individual repository of the tool.
