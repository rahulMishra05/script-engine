# Password Generator using Shell Scripting

### üìù About project

This is a password generator shell script. By usign this script you can generate very good password and that password also have very good complexity.

This script generates the password using **openssl**. OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, and full-featured toolkit for the _Transport Layer Security (TLS)_ and _Secure Socket Layer (SSL)_ protocols. It is also a general-purpose cryptography library. 

In this script I had used `-base64` encoding to genrating the password, it means that the password that will generate from this script will of `-base64` encoding. The range of `-base64` is 48 characters and the password that will generate will be generated randomly from these 48 characters.
